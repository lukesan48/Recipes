        <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>Grilled pulpo or octopus is a dish commonly served as a stunning tapa in the heart of Barcelona or as a center piece dish grilled and served fresh in Greece. The dish marries the succulent tecture of the tentacles with a smoky char gained from a kiss off the grill. Pulling off this dish requires not only patience but technique and a grill master's touch.</p>
